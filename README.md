## How to Run the Game

The game is implemented in the `Rock_Paper_Scissor_game.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

1.  **Open the Notebook**: Open `Rock_Paper_Scissor_game.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, VS Code with Python extension).
2.  **Run the Cells**: Execute the cells in the notebook. The last cell contains the call to `rock_paper_scissors_game()` which will start the game.

Alternatively, you can copy the `rock_paper_scissors_game()` function from the notebook into a Python (`.py`) file (e.g., `game.py`) and run it as follows:

```python
import random # Make sure to include imports if copying the function

def rock_paper_scissors_game():
    # ... (copy the function definition here) ...
    pass # Placeholder for the copied function

# To play the game, call the function:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    rock_paper_scissors_game()
```
